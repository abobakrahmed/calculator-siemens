# Automating React UI Library Sync & Deployment

# **1\. Scope**

The goal of this assessment is to automate the process of synchronizing, testing, and deploying a React UI library across different tools in a company. The UI library developers must ensure that the latest version of the library is always used by the tool developers and that broken or incompatible versions are identified before deployment. Automation will streamline the library's communication, testing, and synchronization, reducing manual efforts and minimizing the risks of using broken or incompatible components.

# **2\. Solution Design**

The system involves the following major components:  
\- React UI Library (TypeScript): This is the shared component library used by all internal tools.  
\- CI/CD Pipeline: For continuous integration and deployment of the library.  
\- Versioning & Release Management: For version control and managing releases.  
\- Automated Testing: To ensure the React components are working as expected.  
\- Artifact Repository (Nexus/Artifactory): For storing private packages and ensuring internal libraries are not exposed publicly.  
\- Notification & Update System: To notify developers of new releases and changes in the library.

# **3\. Automation Components**

## **a. Version Control & Sync (GitLab/GitHub)**

All changes to the React UI library will be managed using Git. The tools developers will be able to pull the latest version automatically from the repository.  
1\. GitLab or GitHub: Used for source code management.  
\- Create branches for feature updates.  
\- Use Merge Requests/PRs to review changes.

## **b. CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

A CI/CD pipeline will automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the React UI library.  
1\. GitLab CI/CD or GitHub Actions: Used for automating the build and deployment process.  
2\. Build Automation: Each change to the UI library triggers a build job.

Example of a test script:

"scripts": {  
  "test": "jest",  
  "build": "tsc && webpack"  
}

## **c. Automated Dependency Updates**

1\. Use Renovate or Dependabot to check for outdated dependencies and automatically create pull requests to update them.  
2\. Use semantic-release and Conventional Commits to automate version bumping.

# **4\. Script Example for CI/CD**

Hereâ€™s an example of a GitLab CI/CD pipeline (.gitlab-ci.yml) that automates testing, building, and publishing the React UI library.

stages:  
  \- test  
  \- build  
  \- deploy

variables:  
  NODE\_ENV: "production"  
  NPM\_REGISTRY\_URL: "http://nexus.internal-company.com/repository/npm-private/"

cache:  
  paths:  
    \- node\_modules/

test:  
  stage: test  
  script:  
    \- npm install  
    \- npm run test  
  only:  
    \- master  
    \- merge\_requests

build:  
  stage: build  
  script:  
    \- npm install  
    \- npm run build  
  artifacts:  
    paths:  
      \- dist/  
  only:  
    \- master

deploy:  
  stage: deploy  
  script:  
    \- npm config set registry $NPM\_REGISTRY\_URL  
    \- npm publish  
  only:  
    \- master
