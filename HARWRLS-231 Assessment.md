# Automating React UI Library Sync & Deployment

# **1\. Scope**

The goal of this assessment is to automate the process of synchronizing, testing, and deploying a React UI library across different tools in a company. 

2\. Solution Design

The system involves the following major components:  
\- React UI Library (TypeScript): This is the shared component library used by all internal tools.  
\- CI/CD Pipeline: For continuous integration and deployment of the library.  
\- Versioning & Release Management: For version control and managing releases.  
\- Automated Testing: To ensure the React components are working as expected.  
\- Artifact Repository (Nexus/Artifactory): For storing private packages and ensuring internal libraries are not exposed publicly.  
\- Notification & Update System: To notify developers of new releases and changes in the library.

# **3\. Automation Components**

## **a. Version Control & Sync (GitLab/GitHub)**

All changes to the React UI library will be managed using Git. The tools developers will be able to pull the latest version automatically from the repository.  
1\. GitHub: Used for source code management.  
\- Create branches for feature updates.  
\- Use Merge Requests/PRs to review changes.

## **b. CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

A CI/CD pipeline will automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the React UI library.  
1\. GitLab CI/CD or GitHub Actions: Used for automating the build and deployment process.  
2\. Build Automation: Each change to the UI library triggers a build job.

Example of a test script:

| "scripts": {  "test": "jest",  "build": "tsc && webpack"} |
| :---- |

## **c. Automated Dependency Updates**

1\. Use Renovate or Dependabot to check for outdated dependencies and automatically create pull requests to update them.  
2\. Use semantic-release and Conventional Commits to automate version bumping.

# **4\. Script Example for CI/CD**

Hereâ€™s an example of a GitLab CI/CD pipeline (.gitlab-ci.yml) that automates testing, building, and publishing the React UI library.
